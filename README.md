## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cooper, a fullstack dev who loves working on new tech and solving real-world problems - check out my portfolio [here](https://cglavin50.github.io/portfolio/).

I am currently working on building web applications with TypeScript and .NET, as well as learning about DevOps through my [raspberry pi homelab](https://github.com/cglavin50/homelab).

I'm always looking for new projects to grow as a developer - please reach out to me at [cooperglavin@gmail.com](mailto:cooperglavin@gmail.com) ðŸ“«
